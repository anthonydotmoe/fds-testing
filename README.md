# FDS Testing

I had this idea to make a serial console for the Famicom. There's an expansion
port on the back of the FDS RAM Adapter that could be used for the cable. But
first I need to familiarize myself with programming for the Famicom/NES. I
learned how to get something running on the FDS [a while ago](https://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=12209.0),
and I got a sprite on screen that I could move with the D-Pad.

The goal here is to make a simple platformer with physics, collision, and
scrolling. If I can get something basic working like that I'll be pretty
satisfied.
