# FDS Testing

I had this idea to make a serial console for the Famicom. There's an expansion
port on the back of the FDS RAM Adapter and I've always been interested in
writing software to a disk that a game console can read and execute, so here we
go!

For now I'm trying to remember how I did things on the NES. I remember I had
something like a Mario sprite you could control with the D-Pad
[way back when](https://www.famicomworld.com/forum/index.php?topic=12209.0), but
it's been a while. So far it just loads into the program and lets you scroll the
screen with the D-Pad
